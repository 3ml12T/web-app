#### Issues

Barbarian originates from the greek word *b√°rbaros* meaning "babbler", to denote the "unintelligle sounds" (_"bar bar bar"_) made by foreign speakers.
Similar words exist in many other languages, for the identical purpose labeling a "strange"/"foriegn" person/culture. 

In modern day usage, you can notice this rhetoric being employed almost always for the purpose of demonizing "foreign" (more often than not from the global south) cultures - cultures that need to be civilized;
cultures that need to be colonized to rescue them from themselves. A perfect lingual weapon for warmongers and racists alike. Equally repulsive sibling of "savage". 

#### Impact

When you use words, that are in vogue primarily inside circles of bigots, with racist etymologies, it's a wilful act of violence, ignorance and an indication to the vilified and minoritized communities that their history of wounds and abuses are inconsequential to our words. 
#### Usage Tip

Avoid words that have obscene etymologies. There is almost always a better alternative: an inclusive and a less hurtful one.
