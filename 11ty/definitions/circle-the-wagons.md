## Issues

"[Circle the wagons] is rooted in stories about "brave pioneers" who were "under attack" by "hostile savages." Hit the pause button.

Those "brave pioneers" were seeking land that belonged to Native peoples who fought to defend that land, their homes, their moms and their kids. Anyone would do that, but the imagery of "circle the wagons" makes Native peoples out as barbaric and aggressive. Who, in fact, was the aggressor?!

More facts: The wagons were circled at night in order to keep the cattle enclosed so they wouldn't wander off. I've also read that, if there was an attack, the wagons were too far apart and slow moving to have actually been put into that circle." â€”[American Indians in Children's Literature](https://americanindiansinchildrensliterature.blogspot.com/p/all-you-do-is-complain.html)

## Impact

By continuing to use this phase, rooted in colonist history and context, while Indigenous people's lands are still being occupied and unceded, we are perpetuating an ongoing history of violence against Indigenous peoples and a falsification of history (most of the imagery around circling wagons as a protective measure was dramatised in Westerns; it was to contain cattle). Seemingly small actions like this contribute to the normalisation of the harm and violence.
